Brain Storming Build Missing files

Here you need to build a module where in you have to create a data structure with below data :-

Name-String
Age-integer
Id-integer
Contact-String
Email-String
Build a program that shall print a user meny first as below :- ============================Main Menu==================================

Show Missing Database -- ?
here for thsi we do not have the access to the database here so you will create a text file for each employee, example user is entering from above menu lets say 1 i.e to add an Employee in the add employee user will be prompted to entr the below details 1. Enter the Name user -> Mary 2. Enter the age user -> xx 3. Enter the contact user -> xx-xx-xxxx 4. Enter the Email user -> Mary@gmail.com

after this the message should be displayed the entries have been saved in (ID of employee) i.e [Employee id].txt -- so that will ve 1.txt, 2.txt,3.txt, 4.txt and the logic hould be built in such a way that employee id should be generated automatically based on the last entry if last was 5.txt then next should be 6.txt
